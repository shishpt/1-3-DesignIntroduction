# White Space / Negative Space in web layouts

### Wait what!!!!! White space doesn't have to be white?

It is a common misconception to think that white space or "negative space" only comes in the form of white color, however negative space can be considered as the dominant color of where an element is placed within a web design (usually it is the background color). Negative space plays a very important role in the design of a web page that ranges from how we perceive text to what our eyes focus on when viewing a web page.


## Structure / Organization

Negative space allows the reader to feel comfortable viewing content on a screen as it helps seperate elements from one another making it easier on the eyes of the viewer.  

The "Z shaped layout formula" is a popular method for how our eyes scan content on a page where we read from the top left to right and then we scan an image or content below which brings our eyes from the right side of the page to the left and then we scan the bottom from left to right.

Another way is the "asymetrical layout", here there is a direct focus to an element as soon as the reader lays their eyes on the page layout.

Negative space assists in showing content organized via margins as the organization is  pleasing to the eye.

Grouping content and elements together by decreasing the white space creates a visual cue which makes it easier for the reader to understand the relationship of the content as a whole.  Seperating groups from one another can be easily acheived then by creating white space between grouped content. 

## Uniformity

Negative space plays a major part in a design layout when it comes to providing a balance between elements.  In order for a layout to have a flow that is calming and pleasureable to the reader there has to be proper contrast of elements to the white space.  This is where negative space balances elements, shapes, and color making the layout easier to read for the reader.

## Typography / Spacing

It is no suprise that white space plays an important role when it comes to spacing and typography, when we view a page filled with text at times it can feel overwhelming, especially when we see a page filled with text that makes us squint due to the small size or we focus closely to the lettering as it's spaced very close together.  On the other end of the spectrum there can be alot of white space between letters and we experience issues where reading a word becomes difficult because when trying to view the word the letters are too far apart creating an issue when trying to process what we're seeing on a page.  It has been mentioned that readability can be increased by up to 20 percent with the right use of white space so finding that balance becomes very important.

It is just as important to mention that line spacing and margins play an intricate role as well in readability.
